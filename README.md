# Piggy Bank Simulation Program
## School Project


## Introduction
This is a pair assignment, and it contributes to 15% of the total grade of this course. 

## Objectives
+ To evaluate student’s skills at writing an object-oriented program using C++ programming
language; \
+ To apply array-based list data structure in solving the problem.

## Description
Your task is to develop a C++ program that simulates a piggy bank and helps kids learn about saving money. The program should allow kids to create a personal account by providing their name and age, and then keep track of their savings balance. Kids should be able to add and withdraw money from their account, with the program storing a record of each transaction along with the date and amount. In addition to the add and withdraw functions, the program should include a delete function that allows kids to remove transactions they have made in the past. This feature can prompt the user to select a transaction to delete and then remove it from the transaction history, giving kids greater control over their savings history. To help kids better understand their savings progress, the program should include an analysis feature that shows the total amount they have saved and withdrawn, along with the average amount saved and withdrawn per day since they started using the program. This can help kids see how their savings habits are improving over time and motivate them to continue saving. The program should also include a view function that displays the transaction history for a specific kid. This feature will display a list of all transactions made by that kid, along with the date and amount. Overall, the program should be easy to use and engaging, helping kids learn valuable financial skills and develop good savings habits.

## Assignment Requirement
Your task is to develop a C++ program that simulates a piggy bank and helps kids learn about saving money. The program should allow each kid to create a personal account by providing their name and age and keep track of their savings balance. The program should enable them to add and withdraw money from their account on different dates and store a record of each transaction. The program should provide a userfriendly interface, allowing kids to easily access and use its features. In addition, the program should reflect the transactions made by each kid accurately, so that they can keep track of their savings progress and identify areas for improvement. Overall, the program should be a valuable learning tool for kids, helping them develop good financial habits and take control of their savings goals. \

Note: It is important to adhere to good software engineering practices while implementing this system. Use appropriate naming conventions, separation of concerns, encapsulation, and error handling. \
Your program must meet the following requirements:
1. Apply the three (3) object-oriented programming principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and basic polymorphism in your solution.
2. Each class should have at least one (1) new attribute, one (1) new method, and one (1) constructor.
3. Each class should contain at least one (1) setter or getter method to set or retrieve the value(s) of the class attribute(s).
4. Create arrays with a maximum size of 10 to store the details of the Task objects.
5. Your program should operate continuously until the user chooses to terminate the program;
6. Create at least five (5) pre-set data in your program. Your program should be able to display all the information of these pre-set delivery requests through the "View All" function once your program is executed; and
7. Submit a report that contains a UML class diagram and screenshots of your program outputs. Your report should not exceed three (3) pages (not including the front cover). Report Format: Font Type - Times New Roman; Font Size – 12; Line Spacing- 1.5; and paragraph text arrangement - justified. The font size captured on the program screenshots and UML diagram should be similar to Times New Roman, size 12.
